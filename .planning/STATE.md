**Core value:** The bot correctly identifies funding rate opportunities and executes delta-neutral positions that collect funding payments without taking directional risk.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bybit fee structures need verification (current maker/taker percentages, spot vs perp differences)
- Margin calculation methods require understanding (how maintenance margin changes during volatility)
- Trade history is in-memory only (lost on restart) — consider persistence for v1.1
