**Core value:** The bot correctly identifies funding rate opportunities and executes delta-neutral positions that collect funding payments without taking directional risk.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Strategy Discovery -- Phase 8 (Pair Analysis Foundation)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
- Reused OpportunityRanker fee formula for PairAnalyzer consistency (08-01)
- Used Counter for dominant interval_hours detection rather than assuming 8h (08-01)
- Sorted ranking with sufficient-data pairs first, then by yield descending (08-01)
- Used IIFE pattern from backtest.html for JS encapsulation consistency (08-02)
- Attached _showDetail to window for onclick access from innerHTML-built rows (08-02)
- Formatted all Decimal strings as percentages (* 100) with 4 decimal places (08-02)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bybit fee structures need verification (carried from v1.0)
- Look-ahead bias risk in backtesting (predicted vs settled funding rates differ)
- CoinGecko symbol mapping may fail for some Bybit pairs -- treat market cap as optional enhancement
- Pairs with insufficient historical data may produce misleading rankings -- enforce minimum data thresholds
- SQL aggregate queries on 50K+ records may need index optimization
