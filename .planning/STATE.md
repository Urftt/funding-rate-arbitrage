## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bybit fee structures need verification (carried from v1.0)
- Look-ahead bias risk in backtesting (predicted vs settled funding rates differ)
- CoinGecko symbol mapping may fail for some Bybit pairs -- treat market cap as optional enhancement
- Pairs with insufficient historical data may produce misleading rankings -- enforce minimum data thresholds
- SQL aggregate queries on 50K+ records may need index optimization
